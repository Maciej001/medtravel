		<h3>Culture</h3>
		<p>You can lose your legs visiting Warsaw's museums and enjoying show in theaters.</p>

			<section>
				<h4>National Museum</h4>
				<p>The National Museum in Warsaw was originally founded in 1862 as the Museum of Fine Arts and is currently one of the oldest art museums in the country. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, the National Museum was ascribed a prominent role in the plans for the new state and its capital city of Warsaw, and the Modernist building in which it currently resides was erected in 1927–1938. Today, the National Museum in Warsaw boasts a collection numbering around 830,000 works of art from Poland and abroad, from ancient times to the present including paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, coins, as well as utilitarian objects and design.</p>

				<h4>Warsaw Uprising Museum</h4>
				<p>The Warsaw Rising Museum was opened on the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of fighting in Warsaw. The Museum is Warsaw residents’ tribute to those who fought and died for independent Poland and its free capital. It is located in a former tram power station, a 20th century landmark of industrial architecture located by Przyokopowa and Grzybowska streets.</p>

		<h3>Shopping</h3>
		<p>Although in the not-too-distant past Poland was a communist block country where its residents could barely buy basic daily essentials, today Poland, and Warsaw in particular, has ample shopping opportunities for residents and visitors alike.</p>

		<h3>Night life</h3>
		<p>Clubbing here is slightly more "high end" than other Eastern cities so dress smart. Your fine threads will make you lots of friends, show a little charm and you'll receive it back. Poles are one of the most hospitable people you will ever meet and Polish girls - one of the most (if not the most) charming in Europe.</p>
