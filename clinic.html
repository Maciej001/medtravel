		<h2>Shopping</h2>
		<h4>Although in the not-too-distant past Poland was a communist bloc country where its residents could barely buy basic daily essentials, today Poland, and Warsaw in particular, has ample shopping opportunities for residents and visitors alike.</h4>

		<h2>Night life</h2>
		<h4>Clubbing here is slightly more "high end" than other Eastern cities so dress smart. Your fine threads will make you lots of friends, show a little charm and you'll receive it back. Poles are one of the most hospitable people you will ever meet and Polish girls - one of the most (if not the most) charming in Europe.</h4>
